Such a person is a full-stack developer who can agilely take care of both front and back-end related requirements.

Unique Appeal of Full Stack Developer
Among the top IT job roles in demand, full stack development occupies a prominent position. This is because of the developer:-

· Can work with different software and tools of varying complexities for meeting unique demands of clients

· Can harness his/her proficiency in JavaScript, CSS, PHP frameworks etc. for providing comprehensive and consummate experience to clients right from conceptualization to execution

· Can gain competence in animation, graphics and designing software for converting sophisticated designs into front-end scripts
Advantages of Full Stack Development

Better Time and Cost Efficiency
The same developer can attend to complexities and issues experienced in front and back ends. She need not explain the problems and code intricacies to others as the entire systemic map exists in her mind. Multiple developers are not required to be hired for different positions.

Optimized Productivity and Efficiency
Knowledge of design and development empowers the developer to troubleshoot issues earnestly. Enriched with insights of the system, she can eliminate bottlenecks efficiently.

Design and Subsequent Implementation Under One Owner
When an in-house solution is being developed, the ownership of conceptualization and execution rests with a single person. This expedites development process and serves as a safeguard for future problems.

Remaining Contemporary is Easy
Since the developer is conversant with multiple tools, she can easily embrace an understanding of recent and relevant software upgrades for faster turnaround.

Root Cause of Problem Gets Addressed
The developer is not concerned with facile solutions. Instead, she harnesses her in-depth command over the system architecture to pinpoint the root cause of effective problem mitigation.

Key Benefits of Becoming A Full Stack Developer
The profile of full stack developer features among the best IT jobs in 2018. This rise in employability quotient can be attributed to the proliferation of start-up ventures and SMEs. They often have to work with a tight budget and seek developers who can manage entire development process single-handedly.

Systemic delays in error rectification are optimally curbed. The developer can work closely with the client and would proactively fulfill expectations as a single point connection source. Remunerations too justify the proficiency levels of developers with handsome pay packages and lucrative career advancements galore.
