In today's advanced, competitive, and digital world, if you talk about taking
your business online in a cost-effective way, there's no better choice than
going with full-stack development services or choosing a full-stack developer.
These developers are versatile and are well-versed in both back-end and
front-end web development. They can be considered multi-talented web development
professionals who can cater to all your website or web app development needs.

Since the dawn of this digital era, most organisations are creating their own
unique online presence through websites or web apps. And the domain of web or
application development is witnessing immense growth like never before. Business
owners are now looking for cost-effective ways to go online and this has
significantly increased the demand for full-stack web development services and
full-stack developers. However, there are millions of developers around today
but choosing a highly skilled one is important to give a competitive edge to the
website or web application.

Here are the skills you need to look for in a full-stack developer before
choosing one for your next project.

Full-stack developers are software development professionals who are equally
proficient in client-side or front-end and server-side or back-end development.
They are familiar with different tech-stacks that are involved in software
development. These professionals have extensive knowledge and a broad skill set
in web development. Here are the skills of a proficient developer discussed in
detail.

## HTML and CSS

While CSS means Cascading Style Sheets and HTML means HyperText Markup language,
CSS is the personalisation tool used for styling and designing a website, HTML
is actually used for adding the website content. Both CSS and HTML determine the
visual appeal or the look of the website that ultimately plays a key role in
attracting potential online customers. Full-stack developers must have a strong
knowledge of both CSS and HTML so that they can easily define the web page
structure using markup and for effectively presenting the HTML elements. They
must have extensive knowledge of both these languages to create intuitive,
interactive, and engaging front-end for the websites or web apps.

## JavaScript

When it comes to website or web application development, JavaScript is one of
the most commonly used programming languages and a full-stack developer must
have in-depth knowledge in this. This Object-oriented language is used for
adding behaviours using HTML. Also, javaScript is used for writing both the
back-end and front-end codes for servers. Moreover, it is the only scripting or
programming language that runs natively on the server-side in the browser. The
developers should have deep knowledge of this language with some other related
concepts like Angular, React, JSON, and DOM.

## Git and GitHub

With Git, web developers can easily and efficiently manage the changes made to
the codes, documents and other data. And every full-stack developer must have a
GitHub profile. Git actually allows developers to track all the major and minor
modifications made to the codebase. Hence, the developers should be aware of the
basic Git commands along with the examples.

## Back-end languages

For efficient back-end development, a developer must be proficient in different
programming languages including PHP, Python, Java, Ruby, and more. The developer
should be familiar with the syntax of these languages and must have practical
experience in using these as per the project requirements.

## Web architecture

A proficient and reliable full-stack developer must be aware of the
Knitty-gritty of web architecture. As their main responsibility is to build
websites and web applications right from scratch, they should know how to easily
structure the codes, maintain the data, categorise the files and perform the
essential computational tasks.

## HTTP and REST

Both these cater to two different purposes. While HTTP is the protocol that is
used to facilitate communication with the clients, the REST is the interface
between the systems using HTTP protocol for gathering the data and performing
different operations on the data. REST can be considered as the translator
between the back-end and front-end. And this makes it essential to look for
full-stack developers who are masters in using both.

## Database storage

Database storage calls for developers who are aware of relational databases as
well as database storage inside-out. These professionals should have expertise
in database management that is designing, understanding, and managing database
queries.

## Basic design skills

As already said that full-stack web development includes both front-end and
back-end development, it is essential to look for a developer who possesses
basic design skills. This is crucial to make the project look attractive, neat,
well organised, and interactive. The developer should have knowledge of the
basic design principles including UI and UX design, scalability, and other
design prototypes.

## Soft skills

Apart from these, a good developer should possess some essential soft skills as
well like learning and adaptability skills with the advancements of
technologies, communication skills, must have a creative vision, and excellent
time-management skills.

So, this is the complete list of skills a full-stack developer possesses. And
there's no better choice than availing full-stack development services when you
want to go online with your business in a cost-effective way.
